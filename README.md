## Installation
Note Taker requires no installation.

## Usage
When users navigate to the site, they are first presented with a landing page. To begin taking notes, they click on the "Get Started" button.

On the form page, users type a note title and their note in the fields filled with default text, which will disappear once they click in the field. When users begin typing in either field, a "Clear Form" button will appear in the header, allowing them to abandon the current note. When both fields have data, a "Save Note" button will also appear in the header. Clicking it allows users to save the current note.

On the left-hand side of the screen is a list of titles of notes that have been saved, and when users save a new note, it will be added to the list. To view a note, users click on the note title in the list. To delete a note, users click on the trashcan icon to the left of each note. While viewing a note, users can click the "New Note" button to clear the form so that it's ready to record the title of a new note and the new note's text.

A screen shot of the form page is below.
